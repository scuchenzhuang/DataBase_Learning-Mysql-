Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State

code:
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT FirstName,LastName, City, State 
FROM Person LEFT JOIN Address
ON Person.PersonId=Address.PersonId

Solution:
  Because not every person has address id.If we use where to search, it will actually drop so many items which dont have the addresses.
  Thats why we use left join,it can show the whole part of left table ignoring whether it has address or not, and then the right table can be shown because
  if there are some Address.personid matches person.personid.
