Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+


# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct a.Num as ConsecutiveNums 
from
(
    select t.Num,    #此处变量连接用逗号分隔开
    @cnt:=if(@pre=t.Num,@cnt+1,1) as cnt, #if语句，用来让cnt赋值增加或者是重新启动一个新的值
    @pre:=t.Num as pre
    from Logs t,(Select @pre:=null,@cnt:=1) as first)   #as first之前的语句是用来搞定初始化的，相当于让pre和cnt初始化，同时不能忘了@cnt的
    #@pre:告诉我们此时，pre是一个user-variable not defined by tables but by users
    as a 
    where a.cnt>=3
